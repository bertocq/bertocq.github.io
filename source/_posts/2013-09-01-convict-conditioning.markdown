All my life I've been a very ¿inquiete? person, almost hiperactive if that therm its still true, that mixed with a belive from my parent that modern toys where bullshit (gameboy, nintendo64, etc..) and tv was for nanies and sick persons (except the Parte and some nature documentaries) made me the kind of child that in the late 80's was still playing in the park instead of trying to emulate the upcoming yankee lifestyle that today reigns

I've practice lots of sports, and got bored of almost all of them because my motivation wasn't wining, it was just play and burn all the energy that my body acumulated in the boring class and homework. Swiming, Judo, Badminton, Football, Basket, Cycling, Runing, Tennis... I stormed from one to other depending of which one got me more tired, until my early teens when basket got my attention because my stature (6'3'') gave me the hability to dunk, and that was so cool :)

Annnd I entered computer sience and found myself sat from 8 to 10h a day, so afternoons and weekends I started to run half-maratons, then ride mtb and road bikes, up to the extrem of both

still got frustrated with being sat all that time, until reading some crappy article of "exercices for sitting on a desk" one of the related oyutube videos of the one that featured the arcticle was someting like "programmers conditioning" and featured a guy in home clothes explaining how to exercise with bodyweight ¿why not a gym? welll I've been ther, nothing interesting for me.. spinning class is crap, the bike doesnt give you any feedback, only 45min isn't enough (I normally stormed the city across traffic like a retarded) and the lifting room is either full of muscle-borderlines or fat injured people, sometimes normal people but still didn't like the ambient and they way it works

so I've had in the past do some exercise with old french and english dictionaries, sand bags and small hand weithgs, abdominales y planchas too but not blablablal
