## Getting the device
This Monday I read about [Movistar launching the ZTE Open](http://firefoxosguide.com/firefox-os/zte-open-to-launch-tomorrow-in-spain-venezuela-colombia-on-15th-july.html/ "Movistar zte open launch"), so I rushed to the nearest [Movistar](http://www.movistar.es "Movistar") shop to ask when they will receive and how many units, but they didn't even know what Firefox OS was about!.

I had to show them my [GeeksPhone Keon and Peak](http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/3-phones "Geeksphone mobiles") and make a quick explanation about the origins and purpose of the new operative system and devices. They promised to call me when the devices arrived and I offered to give them a more extended talk anytime.

And this morning my Google Nexus rang with good news! they received only one unit and luckyly I was the first in line :).

Since I'll be using it for development only, I chose the voice-only plan "Contrato 6" that costs 6â‚¬/month (the minimum spending) because WiFi will be enough.

##Unboxing
As expected the device isn't unlocked, but since the contract doesn't have permanence obligations I was able to get the NCK code to unlock the device by calling the support number 1004, and now I can use it with my [Pepephone](https://www.pepephone.com/ "Pepephone") simcard without problems.

It comes with a Movistar logo on it's back and in a their brand blue color. Also they added a "Mi Movistar" app to access the client panel, and a Settings menu under 'Operator Services' to open the operator chat and email custom services.

The box remembers me of the Geeksphone Peak's, although this one has better quality. The inside of the top comes with a cool Firefox OS logo.

The accesories seems to have worst quality than the Geeksphone ones, even the charger, but indestructibles anyway.

After basic configuration updates kicked in! The basic pack its enough for starters, although the game pack doesn't fit my taste. In the list you can uncheck updates.

## Testing

To test the microphone and video recording indoors I took a [quick video test](www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Ap_CSviQM) with 'Moby Dick' by Led Zeppelin on the background:

[One more video outdoors](www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PVHuJ6A86U) to see how the camera adapted to the changes in luminosity with bright sun:

The main problem interacting with the device is the touch screen, I can't hardly type without failing 1 of 3 letters, it doesn't feel as accurate as my Google Nexus, although the Keon an Peak had similar problems in my experience.

## Thoughts
The ZTE Open its very similar on the outside and inside [compared with the GeeksPhone Keon](http://versus.com/en/geeksphone-keon-vs-zte-open) but its still the only one Firefox OS device for the normal user. I hope Movistar's fork of FirefoxOS will not divert too much from the rest of mobile operators, just to avoid the damm fragmentation that we got on Android right now.

I see it as a feature phone killer for users like my parents: just need the device to be able to call, set alarms, see the calendar and find something on the internet or a map from time to time... and also comes with a nice touch screen and the dimensions are still acceptable for them. Someone is going to get a FirefoxOS device for Christmas!!
