## Getting the device
This Monday I read about [Movistar launching the ZTE Open](http://firefoxosguide.com/firefox-os/zte-open-to-launch-tomorrow-in-spain-venezuela-colombia-on-15th-july.html/ "Movistar zte open launch") so I rushed to the nearest Movistar shop to ask when they will receive and how many, but they didn't even know what Firefox OS was about!.

I had to show them my [GeeksPhone Keon and Peak](http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/3-phones "Geeksphone mobiles") and make a quick explanation about the origins and purpose of the new operative system. So they promised to call me when the devices arrived and I offered to give them a more extended talk anytime.

So this morning my Google Nexus rang with good news! they received only one unit and luckyly I was the first in line :).

Since I'll be using it for development only I chose the voice-only plan that costs 6â‚¬/month (it's the minimum) and for internet connection WiFi will be enough. In a month or so I'll be able to cancel the contract and move to a prepaid plan or just nothing.

##Unboxing
As expected the device isn't unlocked, and comes with a Movistar logo on it's back and on the shutdown screen. Also they added a "Mi Movistar" app to access the client panel, and a Settings menu under Operator Services to open the operator chat and email services.

The box remembers me of the Geeksphone Peak, although this one has better quality. The inside of the top comes with a cool Firefox OS logo.

The accesories seems to have worst quality than the Geeksphone ones, even the charger, but indestructibles anyway.

After basic configuration updates kicked in! There basic pack its enought for starters, although the game pack doesn't fit my taste.

A quick comparation with the GeeksPhone Keon & Peak models.

## Toughts
The ZTE Open its very similar on the outside and inside [compared with the GeeksPhone Keon](http://versus.com/en/geeksphone-keon-vs-zte-open) but its still the only one Firefox OS device for the normal user. I hope Movistar's fork of FirefoxOS will not divert too much from the rest of mobile operators, just to avoid the damm fragmentation that we got on Android right now.
