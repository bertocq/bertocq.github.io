When I heard about [Movistar launching the ZTE Open](http://firefoxosguide.com/firefox-os/zte-open-to-launch-tomorrow-in-spain-venezuela-colombia-on-15th-july.html/ "Movistar zte open launch") this week I rushed to the nearest Movistar shop to ask when they will receive and how many, but they didn't even know what Firefox OS was about!.

I had to show them my [Geeksphone Keon and Peak](http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/3-phones "Geeksphone mobiles") and make a quick explanation about the origins and purpose of the new operative system. So they took my card to call me when the package arrived and maybe explain a bit more another day.

And today has been the day!!, they received only one unit and there was only another person waiting for it but I asked for it first luckyly.

Since I'll be using it for development only I chose the only-voice plan that costs 6â‚¬/month (it's the minimum) and for internet connection WiFi will be enough.
