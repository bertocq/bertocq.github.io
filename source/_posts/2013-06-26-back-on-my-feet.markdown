It's has been a hell of a month, but finally difficulties all over. I have moved between 3 citys in 24 days, with all the logistics it involves (looking for rent houses, transporting?? our things, setting up internet and ligth contracts... etc..)

So we are finally stable and I can get back to business.

A month and 15 days ago I was in Bilbao and fui al firefos os event y conocí a un ídolo @soyjavi y pude charlar unos minutos con el, en el hackathon me encontré solo y reviví una vieja idea de app para lentillas y para mi sorpresa gané la categoría a la mejor app de ehealth con un Geeksphone peak!! More about it here=> Winning a hckathon of fierxox so

So I got an adrenaline rush and started developing dthe app, learning more about firefox os and finally bougth a Keon and got lucky with the review team
=>> Another post with all of this

A month ago I got involved in the review team of mozilla blabalbla

and now Im back to reviews, starting the second phase of the app development, with 2 more ideas and thinking of porting the app to android an ios just because i can and for fun
