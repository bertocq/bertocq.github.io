Why will I write my blog in English and not in Spanish? Well the main goal of this blog is to share my work with profession collegues, and they should have enough english level to understand me, if not... there is something wrong ;)

A few days ago I got an email announcing that I've been accepted as a former Firefox Marketplace App Review Team member, and that there will be a kick-off session June 5.

After the joy and celebration I started to read with enthusiasm the recommended links and realize that even I have a very good english level for earing and writing, but my speaking lacks of practice...

How did I learn english? When it comes to learning I'm the kind of student that fuels with motivation, so normally I procastinated alot when I didn't understood why should a computer engineer learn how algebra works or a composed integral derivation is calculated in a paper.

And English wasn't different, in school I was always avoiding to learn all the vocabulary sheets that the teacher gave to us to memorize like monkeys.

The real motivation appeared when I wanted to understand what the AC/DC lyrics meant, or learn over the internet how CSS worked, and the real burst went with the Lost tv-series, we all wanted to not get spoilered so you just had to download the episodes and struggle to understand the different accents, and give it a second watch when the english subtitles appeared, and the third with the spanish ones... (with some episodes even a 4th re-watch because of the mind-blowing screenplays)

So I'll try to improve even more my English and will find the way to practice it with some native speakers.
