My last blog died because I didn't have the time and motivation to write, mostly because I was tired of installing and modding wordpress for freelance jobs. Long ago I read some articles about Octopress and since many of the blogs I check use it I'm giving it a try.

So here I am, getting back on business, interesting and life-changing things happened to me this year and I think a have enough to write about the past, present and future. I'll be mainly writting about professional on mobile and web development, personal things normally go on facebook lately.

I'll start with some plugins and theme customizations in my spare time. Welcome!
