I was out for a bicycle ride with my girlfriend when she saw a dog about to cross a busy roadway in the distance. We rushed to get her attention, and after drinking some water she didn't want to leave us.

We guided her back to our house, first on the bicycle and then on our arms.

A quick bath to kill parasites, a leash and two bowls, water and food, and she was all love.

Our house isn't very big but still she didn't want to stay alone, so she followed me to my working table and made herself a bed with the couch.

I've never seen a dog so calmed and that didn't resist to anything you wanted to do with her. She took the eyedrop for the red eyes without problem, also the pils and even I could took her in my arms and even looked like she enjoyed it.

The first night she was a bit nervous but fall asleep within 30 minutes, and only got up once in the middle of the night to drink and eat a bit more.

The next day we took here to the local dog care house, the trip in the car was very calm, got her in the trunk with the top opened and she even fall asleep and only took his head out a few times to ensure we still where there.

It was a saturday so the vet left within minutes and only could advice us to give here a pill against worms and some eyedrops

After

* Who got lucky?

* Like a Saint

The Tuesday we made the second visit to the REFUGIO to see their vet. She gave Laky a VACUNA and took a blood sample.. surprisingly Laky didn't even make a movement or sound when the needle went in/out... you can do whatever you want with her, like a big PELUCHE :D



* Progression to the top

Finally after many evasions from dogs, getting betwen our legs and behind triying to hide perfectly.. a cute BROWN WHATEVER found her and slowly got less nervous until Leo convinced her to play, and it was beautiful seeing her transform to a playfull puppy, running like hell and TROPEZANDOSE almost with every bush in his chase

At home she was still very excited, took over an hour to get back to sleeping, she started to bite gently our hands to play, then took my slipper, my girlfriend SWETTER, just finding out that she could really use her mouth to party with us.

We took a little nap together and found out that dogs can fart too :D
