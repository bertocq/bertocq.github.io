A lot has happened since my last post, that made me completely forget the blog. My family got bigger with a girlfriend and a rescued greyhound, we moved 3 more times until she landed a nice job in Albacete for 2 years, and this January she got an awesome opportunity at Madrid that will last 4-5 years at least.

##Netberry & PHP tiredness
During the year and half that we stayed in Albacete I got a job on Web & Mobile development at [Netberry](http://www.netberry.es). It was a good place to work, with a nice family feeling among the co-workers, and made some great friends.

In my first project I built a web application that works [entirely offline](http://diveintohtml5.info/offline.html) in the browser, so a technician working on a solar or eolic plant without connection could still use it. I’ll write about it soon… but basically used [IndexedDB](http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/) for the data, Javascript for the logic and [Cache Manifest](http://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cache_manifest_in_HTML5) to let the files persist without internet.

Also improved a lot my [jQuery](https://jquery.com) and Javascript, learned about framework internals (we used a custom PHP framework built on top of [Zend](http://framework.zend.com))), some custom scripts with [PHPExcel](https://phpexcel.codeplex.com) and [SEPA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_Euro_Payments_Area) data format form bank domiciliations… worked on some cool and big projects, patched legacy code at others… Even got the opportunity to evangelize about [Git](http://git-scm.com), [SublimeText](http://www.sublimetext.com) and [PhpStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/phpstorm).

But definetly got tired of PHP and it’s environment after more than 10 years dealing with passing frameworks, customs CMS’s and Wordpress/Drupal/etc…

##So whats next? Ruby!!
Since we are living in Madrid and there are plenty of job offers for diverse positions, I’ll finally give [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org) a solid chance to change my career and have fun again at work.

Many years has passed since I first tried it, and even got a good chance to work with [RoR](http://rubyonrails.org) (although life got in the way)… but third time’s the charm, because this time I got everything on place.
