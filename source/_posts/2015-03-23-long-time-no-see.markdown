Almost two years has passed since my last post, and a lot happened that made me forgot about my blog: my family got bigger with a girlfriend and a rescued spanish greyhound, we moved again 4 times until she landed a nice job (although not very stable), and months later I got another job on Web & Mobile development in the same city ([Albacete](http://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albacete)).

I stayed 1 year and 4 months working at [Netberry](http://www.netberry.es/), it was good but I got stuck with PHP. And with "stuck" I mean that it sucked all my energy and didn't do any side projects or learning... just work & trail running.

Anyway I enjoyed it, improved a lot my jQuery, learned about framework internals (we used a custom PHP framework built on top of [Zend](http://framework.zend.com/)), some futile investigations about PHPExcel, SEPA data format form bank transfers and domiciliations... worked on some cool and big projects, patched code at horrible ones... but definetly got tired of PHP and mobile dev environments.

Also did a cool project involving IndexedDB and Cache Manifest to make a web application work entirely offline in the web browser of a technician working on Solar and Eolic plants... I'll write about it soon.

On January we got lucky because she landed a great job at Madrid, moved again between citys, but this time will be for a long time, and I'll be changing tracks on my carrer for good... Ruby here we go!
