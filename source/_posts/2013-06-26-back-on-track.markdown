It's has been a hell of a month, but finally difficulties all over. I have moved between 3 citys in 24 days, with all the logistics it involves (looking for rent houses, transporting our things, setting up internet, gas, water and ligth contracts...). Emancipation is hard, but this was a master class!

So we are finally stable and I can get back to business.

Meanwhile I was accepted as in the Firefox App Review Team, and wrote down two more ideas that hopefully will transform in nice FirefoxOS apps one day. Also bought an GeeksPhone Keon so the Peak doesn't feel alone anymore.
