It's has been a hell of a month, but finally difficulties all over. I have moved between 3 citys in 24 days, with all the logistics it involves (looking for rent houses, transporting our things, setting up internet, gas, water and ligth contracts...). Emancipation is hard, but this was a master class!

So we are finally stable and I can get back to business.

More to come.. still writing this one
