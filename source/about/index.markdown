Hello I'm Alberto Calder√≥n Queimadelos, a web developer from Spain.

I've been developing websites since I was a teenager, I enjoy the process of analyzing the needs, designing the best solution, planning ahead, and making it work for everyone with a user agent.

Although I've experience in front-end, mobile (native & hybrid), and R+D+I... the back-end is my home when the coding comes along. With 10+ years on PHP, I'm in the path to master Ruby an its environment in a new phase.
