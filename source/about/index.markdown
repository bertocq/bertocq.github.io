My name is Alberto Calderón Queimadelos, I'm a mobile & web developer from Spain.

I'm currently working on two personal projects with Firefox OS but still open for freelance projects as always.

I've used native iOS and Android on mobile development, but now I'm mainly working with Firefox OS since I won a [Geeksphone Peak in the Bilbao FirefoxOS Hackathon](blog/winning-a-firefox-os-hackathon).

On web dev I've experience on both front (HTML5 + CSS3 + Javascript) and back-end (PHP, J2EE and RoR).
