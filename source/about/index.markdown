My name is Alberto Calderón Queimadelos, I'm a mobile & web developer from Spain.

Currently I'm living in [Albacete](http://goo.gl/maps/lf1qI "Albacete position in Google Maps") and working in freelance and personal projects, if you are interested in working together feel free to contact ;).

I've experience with iOS and Android apps, but now I'm mainly working with Firefox OS since I won a Geeksphone Peak in the Bilbao FirefoxOS Hackathon.

On web dev I've done both front (HTML5 + CSS3 + Javascript) and back-end (PHP, J2EE and RoR).
