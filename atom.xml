<h2>Getting the device</h2>

<p>This Monday I read about <a href="http://firefoxosguide.com/firefox-os/zte-open-to-launch-tomorrow-in-spain-venezuela-colombia-on-15th-july.html/" title="Movistar zte open launch">Movistar launching the ZTE Open</a>, so I rushed to the nearest <a href="http://www.movistar.es" title="Movistar">Movistar</a> shop to ask when they will receive and how many units, but they didn&rsquo;t even know what Firefox OS was about!.</p>

<p>I had to show them my <a href="http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/3-phones" title="Geeksphone mobiles">GeeksPhone Keon and Peak</a> and make a quick explanation about the origins and purpose of the new operative system and devices. They promised to call me when the devices arrived and I offered to give them a more extended talk anytime.</p>

<p>And this morning my Google Nexus rang with good news! they received only one unit and luckyly I was the first in line :).</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ll be using it for development only, I chose the voice-only plan &ldquo;Contrato 6&rdquo; that costs 6â‚¬/month (the minimum spending) because WiFi will be enough.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-J_ZmhGWhG8M/UdRuQRbysOI/AAAAAAAAD-0/JjFW0YrvCDg/w907-h680-no/P1080104.JPG" width="500" height="500" title="s made of thin cardboard but seems cool" alt="The box it"></p>

<hr />

<h2>Unboxing</h2>

<p>As expected the device isn&rsquo;t unlocked, but since the contract doesn&rsquo;t have permanence obligations I was able to get the NCK code to unlock the device by calling the support number 1004, and now I can use it with my <a href="https://www.pepephone.com/" title="Pepephone">Pepephone</a> simcard without problems.</p>

<p>It comes with a Movistar logo on it&rsquo;s back and in a their brand blue color. Also they added a &ldquo;Mi Movistar&rdquo; app to access the client panel, and a Settings menu under &lsquo;Operator Services&rsquo; to open the operator chat and email custom services.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Y2zQX5Q4AVM/UdRuP_bfxmI/AAAAAAAAD-o/sZGtC0vywGY/w907-h680-no/P1080115.JPG" width="500" height="500" title="There seems to be a mix of logos still between desktop and mobile" alt="There seems to be a mix of logos still between desktop and mobile"></p>

<p>The box remembers me of the Geeksphone Peak&rsquo;s, although this one has better quality. The inside of the top comes with a cool Firefox OS logo.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H4rIlPvX5G8/UdRuQ5pTc_I/AAAAAAAAD_E/xmu7ZqLSz1k/w907-h680-no/P1080120.JPG" width="500" height="500" title="I would love to have a sticker with this logo" alt="I would love to have a sticker with this logo"></p>

<p>The accesories seems to have worst quality than the Geeksphone ones, even the charger, but indestructibles anyway.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ki0kfByT3_Y/UdRuRoPzPyI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/7zpyLvL_8KE/w907-h680-no/P1080122.JPG" width="500" height="500" title="Charger, earphones, usb cable, and paper stuff" alt="Charger, earphones, usb cable, and paper stuff"></p>

<p>After basic configuration updates kicked in! The basic pack its enough for starters, although the game pack doesn&rsquo;t fit my taste. In the list you can uncheck updates.</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrFJI-saUSs/UdRuR8579eI/AAAAAAAAD_M/aFP3kjL1IGY/w987-h740-no/P1080125.JPG" width="500" height="500" title="You can uncheck the updates you dont want now" alt="You can uncheck the updates you dont want now"></p>

<p>A quick comparation with the GeeksPhone Keon &amp; Peak models.</p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>To test the microphone and video recording indoors I took a <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=x5Ap_CSviQM">quick video test</a> with &lsquo;Moby Dick&rsquo; by Led Zeppelin on the background:</p>

<div class="centered">
<iframe width="500" height="360" src="http://bertocq.es//www.youtube.com/embed/x5Ap_CSviQM?rel=0"  allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p><a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=9PVHuJ6A86U">One more video outdoors</a> to see how the camera adapted to the changes in luminosity with bright sun:</p>

<div class="centered">
<iframe width="500" height="360" src="http://bertocq.es//www.youtube.com/embed/9PVHuJ6A86U?rel=0"  allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div>


<p>And a sample photo indoor:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-pop8B2A7fDc/UdVM4G-cTEI/AAAAAAAAEBY/ehl_tQGjkr8/s512/IMG_0008.jpg" width="500" height="500" title=" I love the inside of the box" alt="I love the inside of the box"></p>

<p>and outdoors:</p>

<p><img class="center" src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Gt1iuh3VvBk/UdawfhEPj0I/AAAAAAAAEC0/bnPVzORoEWs/s720/IMG_0036.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="Fun fact: thats a Police Station!" alt="Fun fact: thats a Police Station!"></p>

<p>The main problem interacting with the device is the touch screen, I can&rsquo;t hardly type without failing 1 of 3 letters, it doesn&rsquo;t feel as accurate as my Google Nexus, although the Keon an Peak had similar problems in my experience.</p>

<hr />

<h2>Review</h2>

<p>Well there are actually lots of good unboxing post and videos if you want to take a deeper view on the mobile device (all in Spanish):</p>

<h2>Thoughts</h2>

<p>The ZTE Open its very similar on the outside and inside <a href="http://versus.com/en/geeksphone-keon-vs-zte-open">compared with the GeeksPhone Keon</a> but its still the only one Firefox OS device for the normal user. I hope Movistar&rsquo;s fork of FirefoxOS will not divert too much from the rest of mobile operators, just to avoid the damm fragmentation that we got on Android right now.</p>

<p>I see it as a feature phone killer for users like my parents: just need the device to be able to call, set alarms, see the calendar and find something on the internet or a map from time to time&hellip; and also comes with a nice touch screen and the dimensions are still acceptable for them. Someone is going to get a FirefoxOS device for Christmas!!</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>It&rsquo;s has been a hell of a month, but finally difficulties all over. I have moved between 3 citys in 24 days, with all the logistics it involves (looking for rent houses, transporting our things, setting up internet, gas, water and ligth contracts&hellip;). Emancipation is hard, but this was a master class!</p>

<p>So we are finally stable and I can get back to business.</p>

<p>Meanwhile I was accepted as in the Firefox App Review Team, and wrote down two more ideas that hopefully will transform in nice FirefoxOS apps one day. Also bought an GeeksPhone Keon so the Peak doesn&rsquo;t feel alone anymore.</p>

    <updated>2013-06-03T18:42:00+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://bertocq.es/blog/winning-a-firefox-os-hackathon</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On May 17th there was a <a href="http://espana.movilforum.com/jornadaffoxosbilbao/">FirefoxOS Day at the Bilbao University</a>, and later a hackathon.</p>

<p>I had the oportunitty to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/soyjavi">@soyjavi</a>, it&rsquo;s always a bit weird to talk to someone well known that you follow on videocast and twitter but he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue of who you are.</p>

<p>The talks where great and inspiring, speakers <a href="https://twitter.com/jmcantera">@jmcantera</a> and <a href="https://github.com/crdlc">Cristian Rodriguez</a> I still had some memories from the talk on the past SpainJS conferences where I was able to touch the first prototype:</p>

<p> <img class="center" src="http://distilleryimage5.ak.instagram.com/7a79c2aac6ef11e1b10e123138105d6b_7.jpg" width="500" height="500" title="Winning a GeeksPhone Peak" alt="Winning a GeeksPhone Peak"></p>

<p>Some GeeksPhone devices where given as prize for technical questions but it felt almost random.</p>

<p>After a good lunchbrake that replenished my energies (I had traveled 285km by car that day without rest) I headed to the hackathon. But I didn&rsquo;t knew anyone, and everybody seemed to had his group of pals and even some good ideas well prepared. There was going to be 4 categories to win a GeeksPhone device so it was totally a competition.</p>

<p>I was just hoping to at least learn how to create a basic app and be able to push it to a real device. I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/crdlc/puzzle">example app</a> from Cristian&rsquo;s github, and started to make changes to see what I could do.</p>

<p>Then I remembered a app idea that I had almost a year ago, very basic but still used the alarm and notification <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI" title="WebApi Mozilla">WebApi&rsquo;s</a> so I spent 15 or 20 minutes trying to define what the app would be able to do and the incremental steps.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jffos&amp;src=hash">#jffos</a> hackathoneando <a href="http://t.co/R6cucvEGxm">pic.twitter.com/R6cucvEGxm</a></p>&mdash; movilforum (@movilf) <a href="https://twitter.com/movilf/statuses/335409077935013891">May 17, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://bertocq.es//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>The first problem was the FirefoxOS simulator, that didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to handle the Alarms WebApi and until I found that hitting Command+R the app wash refreshed so I didn&rsquo;t need to push it again and again. Then I made a simple visor.html to test the visual styles on the browser more quickly:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Simple iframe to test the looks on the browser </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;index.html&quot;</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;320px&quot;</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;480px&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After 3 hours the time ran out and each group made a quick presentation in 1-2 minutes, we saw great but incompleted ideas, some others fully developed but a bit useful, and the greater ones where just awesome like their whatsapp clone Firetalk!</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jffos&amp;src=hash">#jffos</a> vamos a hacer un cliente de mensajerÃ­a :-) <a href="http://t.co/6QZvor1ow5">pic.twitter.com/6QZvor1ow5</a></p>&mdash; movilforum (@movilf) <a href="https://twitter.com/movilf/statuses/335421031898570752">May 17, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://bertocq.es//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>Then the jury went out of the room and I started to pack my things because I was very hungry and still had a 1 hour ride back home. But I was awared with the prize to the best app in the e-Health  category, didn&rsquo;t truly believe it and even felt like it wasn&rsquo;t quite deserved, but talking before with the jury they told me that being alone and able to deliver a functional and useful app was the key for me to win.</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet center"><p>pues tras la deliberaciÃ³n del jurado tenemos a los ganadores <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jffos&amp;src=hash">#jffos</a> <a href="http://t.co/D2IRJHldo2">pic.twitter.com/D2IRJHldo2</a></p>&mdash; movilforum (@movilf) <a href="https://twitter.com/movilf/statuses/335426034054856705">May 17, 2013</a></blockquote>


<script async src="http://bertocq.es//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>So thats the story of how I got my GeeksPhone Peak all alone in a hackathon 285km far from home ;)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>My last blog died because I didn&rsquo;t have the time and motivation to write, mostly because I was tired of installing and modding wordpress for freelance jobs. Long ago I read some articles about Octopress and since many of the blogs I check use it I&rsquo;m giving it a try.</p>

<p>So here I am, getting back on business, interesting and life-changing things happened to me this year and I think a have enough to write about the past, present and future. I&rsquo;ll be mainly writting about professional on mobile and web development, personal things normally go on facebook lately.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll start with some plugins and theme customizations in my spare time. Welcome!</p>
