<h2>Getting the device</h2>

<p>This Monday I read about <a href="http://firefoxosguide.com/firefox-os/zte-open-to-launch-tomorrow-in-spain-venezuela-colombia-on-15th-july.html/" title="Movistar zte open launch">Movistar launching the ZTE Open</a> so I rushed to the nearest Movistar shop to ask when they will receive and how many, but they didn&rsquo;t even know what Firefox OS was about!.</p>

<p>I had to show them my <a href="http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/3-phones" title="Geeksphone mobiles">GeeksPhone Keon and Peak</a> and make a quick explanation about the origins and purpose of the new operative system. So they promised to call me when the devices arrived and I offered to give them a more extended talk anytime.</p>

<p>So this morning my Google Nexus rang with good news! they received only one unit and luckyly I was the first in line :).</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ll be using it for development only I chose the voice-only plan that costs 6â‚¬/month (it&rsquo;s the minimum) and for internet connection WiFi will be enough. In a month or so I&rsquo;ll be able to cancel the contract and move to a prepaid plan or just nothing.</p>

<h2>Unboxing</h2>

<p>As expected the device isn&rsquo;t unlocked, but since I got the &ldquo;Contrato 6&rdquo; plan that has no permanence obligation and I got no debts with Movistar I was able to get de NCK number to unlock de device just calling the 1004 number!.</p>

<p>It comes with a Movistar logo on it&rsquo;s back and on the shutdown screen. Also they added a &ldquo;Mi Movistar&rdquo; app to access the client panel, and a Settings menu under Operator Services to open the operator chat and email services.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Y2zQX5Q4AVM/UdRuP_bfxmI/AAAAAAAAD-o/sZGtC0vywGY/w907-h680-no/P1080115.JPG">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Y2zQX5Q4AVM/UdRuP_bfxmI/AAAAAAAAD-o/sZGtC0vywGY/w907-h680-no/P1080115.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [There seems to be a mix of logos still between desktop and mobile [There seems to be a mix of logos still between desktop and mobile ]]" ></p>

<p>The box remembers me of the Geeksphone Peak, although this one has better quality. The inside of the top comes with a cool Firefox OS logo.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H4rIlPvX5G8/UdRuQ5pTc_I/AAAAAAAAD_E/xmu7ZqLSz1k/w907-h680-no/P1080120.JPG">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H4rIlPvX5G8/UdRuQ5pTc_I/AAAAAAAAD_E/xmu7ZqLSz1k/w907-h680-no/P1080120.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [I would love to have a sticker with this logo [I would love to have a sticker with this logo]]" ></p>

<p>The accesories seems to have worst quality than the Geeksphone ones, even the charger, but indestructibles anyway.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ki0kfByT3_Y/UdRuRoPzPyI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/7zpyLvL_8KE/w907-h680-no/P1080122.JPG">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ki0kfByT3_Y/UdRuRoPzPyI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/7zpyLvL_8KE/w907-h680-no/P1080122.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>After basic configuration updates kicked in! There basic pack its enought for starters, although the game pack doesn&rsquo;t fit my taste.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrFJI-saUSs/UdRuR8579eI/AAAAAAAAD_M/aFP3kjL1IGY/w987-h740-no/P1080125.JPG">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrFJI-saUSs/UdRuR8579eI/AAAAAAAAD_M/aFP3kjL1IGY/w987-h740-no/P1080125.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>A quick comparation with the GeeksPhone Keon &amp; Peak models.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o9jojSrtCTY/UdRuTmfoIxI/AAAAAAAAD_s/KV_d_guj2zE/w907-h680-no/P1080144.JPG">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o9jojSrtCTY/UdRuTmfoIxI/AAAAAAAAD_s/KV_d_guj2zE/w907-h680-no/P1080144.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>My Google Nexus feeling his near death.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPgHhOEQqVg/UdRuUUl0ROI/AAAAAAAAD_0/YY_r9v1UMVk/w907-h680-no/P1080152.JPG">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPgHhOEQqVg/UdRuUUl0ROI/AAAAAAAAD_0/YY_r9v1UMVk/w907-h680-no/P1080152.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<h2>Testing</h2>

<p>Just took a quick video with Moby Dick by Led Zeppelin on the background:</p>

<iframe class="center" width="420" height="315" src="http://bertocq.es//www.youtube.com/embed/x5Ap_CSviQM?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>


<p>And a sample photo:</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pop8B2A7fDc/UdVM4G-cTEI/AAAAAAAAEBY/ehl_tQGjkr8/w510-h680-no/IMG_0008.jpg">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-pop8B2A7fDc/UdVM4G-cTEI/AAAAAAAAEBY/ehl_tQGjkr8/w510-h680-no/IMG_0008.jpg</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>The main problem interacting with the device is the touch screen, I can&rsquo;t hardly type without failing 1 of 3 letters, it doesn&rsquo;t feel as accurate as my Google Nexus, although the Keon an Peak wasn&rsquo;t too far on this.</p>

<h2>Toughts</h2>

<p>The ZTE Open its very similar on the outside and inside <a href="http://versus.com/en/geeksphone-keon-vs-zte-open">compared with the GeeksPhone Keon</a> but its still the only one Firefox OS device for the normal user. I hope Movistar&rsquo;s fork of FirefoxOS will not divert too much from the rest of mobile operators, just to avoid the damm fragmentation that we got on Android right now.</p>
