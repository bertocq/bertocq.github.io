    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<blockquote><p>This is just a quick post, I&rsquo;ll update and improve after getting some sleep</p></blockquote>

<h2>Getting the device</h2>

<p>This Monday I read about <a href="http://firefoxosguide.com/firefox-os/zte-open-to-launch-tomorrow-in-spain-venezuela-colombia-on-15th-july.html/" title="Movistar zte open launch">Movistar launching the ZTE Open</a> so I rushed to the nearest Movistar shop to ask when they will receive and how many, but they didn&rsquo;t even know what Firefox OS was about!.</p>

<p>I had to show them my <a href="http://shop.geeksphone.com/en/3-phones" title="Geeksphone mobiles">GeeksPhone Keon and Peak</a> and make a quick explanation about the origins and purpose of the new operative system. So they promised to call me when the devices arrived and I offered to give them a more extended talk anytime.</p>

<p>So this morning my Google Nexus rang with good news! they received only one unit and luckyly I was the first in line :).</p>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ll be using it for development only I chose the voice-only plan that costs 6€/month (it&rsquo;s the minimum) and for internet connection WiFi will be enough. In a month or so I&rsquo;ll be able to cancel the contract and move to a prepaid plan or just nothing.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-J_ZmhGWhG8M/UdRuQRbysOI/AAAAAAAAD-0/JjFW0YrvCDg/w907-h680-no/P1080104.JPG">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-J_ZmhGWhG8M/UdRuQRbysOI/AAAAAAAAD-0/JjFW0YrvCDg/w907-h680-no/P1080104.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [The box it&rsquo;s made of thin cardboard but seems cool [The box it&rsquo;s made of thin cardboard but seems cool]]" ></p>

<h2>Unboxing</h2>

<p>As expected the device isn&rsquo;t unlocked, and comes with a Movistar logo on it&rsquo;s back and on the shutdown screen. Also they added a &ldquo;Mi Movistar&rdquo; app to access the client panel, and a Settings menu under Operator Services to open the operator chat and email services.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Y2zQX5Q4AVM/UdRuP_bfxmI/AAAAAAAAD-o/sZGtC0vywGY/w907-h680-no/P1080115.JPG">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-Y2zQX5Q4AVM/UdRuP_bfxmI/AAAAAAAAD-o/sZGtC0vywGY/w907-h680-no/P1080115.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [There seems to be a mix of logos still between desktop and mobile [There seems to be a mix of logos still between desktop and mobile ]]" ></p>

<p>The box remembers me of the Geeksphone Peak, although this one has better quality. The inside of the top comes with a cool Firefox OS logo.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H4rIlPvX5G8/UdRuQ5pTc_I/AAAAAAAAD_E/xmu7ZqLSz1k/w907-h680-no/P1080120.JPG">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-H4rIlPvX5G8/UdRuQ5pTc_I/AAAAAAAAD_E/xmu7ZqLSz1k/w907-h680-no/P1080120.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [I would love to have a sticker with this logo [I would love to have a sticker with this logo]]" ></p>

<p>The accesories seems to have worst quality than the Geeksphone ones, even the charger, but indestructibles anyway.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ki0kfByT3_Y/UdRuRoPzPyI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/7zpyLvL_8KE/w907-h680-no/P1080122.JPG">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-ki0kfByT3_Y/UdRuRoPzPyI/AAAAAAAAD_Q/7zpyLvL_8KE/w907-h680-no/P1080122.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>After basic configuration updates kicked in! There basic pack its enought for starters, although the game pack doesn&rsquo;t fit my taste.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrFJI-saUSs/UdRuR8579eI/AAAAAAAAD_M/aFP3kjL1IGY/w987-h740-no/P1080125.JPG">https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-SrFJI-saUSs/UdRuR8579eI/AAAAAAAAD_M/aFP3kjL1IGY/w987-h740-no/P1080125.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>A quick comparation with the GeeksPhone Keon &amp; Peak models.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o9jojSrtCTY/UdRuTmfoIxI/AAAAAAAAD_s/KV_d_guj2zE/w907-h680-no/P1080144.JPG">https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/-o9jojSrtCTY/UdRuTmfoIxI/AAAAAAAAD_s/KV_d_guj2zE/w907-h680-no/P1080144.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<p>My Google Nexus feeling his near death.</p>

<p><img class="center <a" src="href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPgHhOEQqVg/UdRuUUl0ROI/AAAAAAAAD_0/YY_r9v1UMVk/w907-h680-no/P1080152.JPG">https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-mPgHhOEQqVg/UdRuUUl0ROI/AAAAAAAAD_0/YY_r9v1UMVk/w907-h680-no/P1080152.JPG</a>" width="500" title="auto [ []]" ></p>

<h2>Toughts</h2>

<p>The ZTE Open its very similar on the outside and inside <a href="http://versus.com/en/geeksphone-keon-vs-zte-open">compared with the GeeksPhone Keon</a> but its still the only one Firefox OS device for the normal user. I hope Movistar&rsquo;s fork of FirefoxOS will not divert too much from the rest of mobile operators, just to avoid the damm fragmentation that we got on Android right now.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>On May 17th there was a <a href="http://espana.movilforum.com/jornadaffoxosbilbao/">FirefoxOS Day at the Bilbao University</a>, and later a hackathon.</p>

<p>I had the oportunitty to talk with <a href="https://twitter.com/soyjavi">@soyjavi</a>, it&rsquo;s always a bit weird to talk to someone well known that you follow on videocast and twitter but he doesn&rsquo;t have a clue of who you are.</p>

<p>The talks where great and inspiring, speakers <a href="https://twitter.com/jmcantera">@jmcantera</a> and <a href="https://github.com/crdlc">Cristian Rodriguez</a> I still had some memories from the talk on the past SpainJS conferences where I was able to touch the first prototype:</p>

<p> <img class="center <a" src="href="http://distilleryimage5.ak.instagram.com/7a79c2aac6ef11e1b10e123138105d6b_7.jpg">http://distilleryimage5.ak.instagram.com/7a79c2aac6ef11e1b10e123138105d6b_7.jpg</a>" width="500" title="auto [Winning a GeeksPhone Peak[] ]" ></p>

<p>Some GeeksPhone devices where given as prize for technical questions but it felt almost random.</p>

<p>After a good lunchbrake that replenished my energies (I had traveled 285km by car that day without rest) I headed to the hackathon. But I didn&rsquo;t knew anyone, and everybody seemed to had his group of pals and even some good ideas well prepared. There was going to be 4 categories to win a GeeksPhone device so it was totally a competition.</p>

<p>I was just hoping to at least learn how to create a basic app and be able to push it to a real device. I cloned the <a href="https://github.com/crdlc/puzzle">example app</a> from Cristian&rsquo;s github, and started to make changes to see what I could do.</p>

<p>Then I remembered a app idea that I had almost a year ago, very basic but still used the alarm and notification <a href="https://wiki.mozilla.org/WebAPI" title="WebApi Mozilla">WebApi&rsquo;s</a> so I spent 15 or 20 minutes trying to define what the app would be able to do and the incremental steps.</p>

<script async src="http://bertocq.es//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>The first problem was the FirefoxOS simulator, that didn&rsquo;t seem to be able to handle the Alarms WebApi and until I found that hitting Command+R the app wash refreshed so I didn&rsquo;t need to push it again and again. Then I made a simple visor.html to test the visual styles on the browser more quickly:</p>

<p><div class='bogus-wrapper'><notextile><figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Simple iframe to test the looks on the browser </span></figcaption>
 <div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='html'><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;/p&gt;</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nt">&lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe</span> <span class="na">src=</span><span class="s">&quot;index.html&quot;</span> <span class="na">width=</span><span class="s">&quot;320px&quot;</span> <span class="na">height=</span><span class="s">&quot;480px&quot;</span> <span class="nt">/&gt;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure></notextile></div></p>

<p>After 3 hours the time ran out and each group made a quick presentation in 1-2 minutes, we saw great but incompleted ideas, some others fully developed but a bit useful, and the greater ones where just awesome like their whatsapp clone Firetalk!</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jffos&amp;src=hash">#jffos</a> vamos a hacer un cliente de mensajería :&ndash;) <a href="http://t.co/6QZvor1ow5">pic.twitter.com/6QZvor1ow5</a></p>&mdash; movilforum (@movilf) <a href="https://twitter.com/movilf/statuses/335421031898570752">May 17, 2013</a></blockquote>
<script async src="http://bertocq.es//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></p>

<p>Then the jury went out of the room and I started to pack my things because I was very hungry and still had a 1 hour ride back home. But I was awared with the prize to the best app in the e-Health  category, didn&rsquo;t truly believe it and even felt like it wasn&rsquo;t quite deserved, but talking before with the jury they told me that being alone and able to deliver a functional and useful app was the key for me to win.</p>

<p><blockquote class="twitter-tweet center"><p>pues tras la deliberación del jurado tenemos a los ganadores <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23jffos&amp;src=hash">#jffos</a> <a href="http://t.co/D2IRJHldo2">pic.twitter.com/D2IRJHldo2</a></p>&mdash; movilforum (@movilf) <a href="https://twitter.com/movilf/statuses/335426034054856705">May 17, 2013</a></blockquote>

<p>So thats the story of how I got my GeeksPhone Peak all alone in a hackathon 285km far from home ;)</p>
